UPDATING THE UNDERLYING EXCEL MODEL

The calculating engine of this tool is contained in the decc_2050_model gem. Find out more about that at:
http://github.com/decc/decc_2050_model

UPDATING THE EXAMPLE PATHWAYS

The example pathways are listed in:

    app/helpers/application_helper.rb

UPDATING THE ONE PAGE NOTES

The one page notes are separate pdf files in:

    app/assets/images/onepage

If the order of the controls is changed, or a new control is added, then the mapping in the underlying decc_2050_model code also needs to be changed:

  In this code:  

    http://github.com/decc/decc_2050_model

  Look in this file:

    lib/decc_2050_model/model_choice.rb

  And change the NUMBER_TO_DOC_MAP. The left hand number is a counter, based on the row number in the Excel Control worksheet. 0 is the first row of the controls (Nuclear power). The right hand number or text is the filename of the relevant one page note pdf in app/assets/images/onepage
