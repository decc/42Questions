    <h1>Average temperature of homes</h1>
    <p>The mean internal temperature of UK homes during the winter months was 17.5˚C in 2007, compared to 16˚C in 1990. Almost no homes had air conditioning. Historically, the temperature people choose to heat their homes to has increased over the years.</p>

      <h2>Level 1</h2>
      <div class='description'>
        <p>Level 1 assumes that the mean internal temperature of UK homes during the winter months continues to increase to 20˚C in 2030, then stabilises. Use of air conditioning grows to 50 TWh/y in 2050.</p>

      <h2>Level 2</h2>
      <div class='description'>
        <p>Level 2 assumes that the mean temperature increases slightly to 18˚C in 2050. Use of air conditioning grows to 31 TWh/y in 2050.</p>

      <h2>Level 3</h2>
      <div class='description'>
        <p>Level 3 assumes that the mean temperature decreases slightly to 17˚C in 2050. Use of air conditioning grows to 14 TWh/y in 2050.</p>
      </div>

    <div class='choice' id='choice4'>
      <h2>Level 4</h2>
      <div class='description'>
        <p>Level 4 assumes that the mean temperature decreases to 16˚C in 2050 , which  is equivalent to the mean internal house temperature in 1990. There is no use of air conditioning in the summer.</p>
        <p>Householders can experience today’s levels of thermal comfort while also reducing energy demand by wearing warmer clothing or by heating the house in a smarter way. Using a 13 TOG winter duvet rather than a 12 TOG one offers the same level of thermal comfort in a house with a 1.5˚C lower internal temperature. Similarly, wearing one extra layer of clothing can compensate for a 1.5˚C drop in temperature. For an older home that is otherwise maintained at 17.5˚C, an alternative to reducing the temperature by 1.5°C is to leave it unheated for two or three additional hours per day, which is likely to result in the same energy savings.</p>
