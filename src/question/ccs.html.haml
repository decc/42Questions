%p Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology captures carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) from fossil fuel power stations and pipes it into deep underground structures such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs, where it will remain stored forever. Up to 90% of the CO<sub>2</sub> from a fossil fuel power station could be captured using CCS technology. CCS is unproven on a large scale, as yet. 
      
#ccsQuantity
  .trajectory.trajectory1
    %b Level 1
    assumes that, aside from the coal and gas demonstration projects currently planned, there is no further construction of new CCS plants or retrofitting of CCS technology.

  .trajectory.trajectory2
    %b Level 2 
    assumes that CCS technology is developed successfully and that by 2050 the UK buries between 79 and 164 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per year (depending on whether the fuel is gas or coal). This is similar to the amount of oil that was handled each year at the peak of the UK’s North Sea oil industry. 40 GW of CCS-fitted power plants effectively replace the UK’s existing fleet of fossil fuel power stations, providing around 260 TWh/y of output. That means building about 30 1.2-GW power stations. 

  .trajectory.trajectory3
    %b Level 3 
    assumes that the UK builds 53 GW of CCS power station capacity by 2050, which is about 45 1.2-GW power stations, producing around 370 TWh/y of electricity.

  .trajectory.trajectory4
    %b Level 4 
    assumes that the UK builds 87 GW of CCS power stations by 2050, equivalent to around 70 1.2-GW power stations, producing around 560 TWh/y of output. Such a build rate is similar to the rate at which gas power stations were built during the 1990s but sustaining this level of construction for the period of time needed has never been done before. This amount of CCS plant also requires the construction of infrastructure for transporting and storing the captured CO<sub>2</sub> on a large scale.

%h1 What fuel should the CCS power stations use?

%p The 2050 Calculator allows CCS power stations to be fueled by a solid fuel (coal or biomass if it is available) or a gaseous fuel (natural gas or a biogas if it is available). Any available biofuel is used in preference to the equivalent fossil fuel.

%p All of the trajectories below assume that the four CCS demonstration projects built in level 1 of the ‘CCS power stations’ lever consist of three coal plants and one gas plant. The different fuel trajectories only apply to any commercial-scale CCS plants built in addition to these four demonstration plants (in levels 2-4).
    
#ccsFuel
  .trajectory.trajectory1
    %b Trajectory A
    assumes that all CCS power stations use solid fuel (coal or biomass).
    
  .trajectory.trajectory2
    %b Trajectory B
    assumes that two-thirds of CCS power stations use solid fuel (coal or biomass), and the rest use gas (natural gas or biogas).
    
  .trajectory.trajectory3
    %b Trajectory C
    assumes that two-thirds of CCS power stations use gas (natural gas or biogas), and the rest use solid fuel (coal or biomass).
    
  .trajectory.trajectory4
    %b Trajectory D
    assumes that all CCS power stations use gas (natural gas or biogas).
      
%h2 Interaction with other choices

%p There is significant demand for CO<sub>2</sub> transport infrastructure and storage capacity in three sectors: industry, carbon capture and storage power stations, and geosequestration.  Calculator users may wish to consider these options together to take a view on whether the total demand for CO<sub>2</sub> transport and storage infrastructure is feasible.

%p Plants capture CO2 from the atmosphere as they grow, which they store in the form of biomass. The UK can take advantage of this by harvesting the biomass and burning it in electricity generation plants which are fitted with CCS infrastructure. This would ensure that up to 90% of the CO2 sequestered from the atmosphere by plants is stored underground in designated CCS facilities. This process is called bioenergy plus carbon capture and storage (BECCS).

%p A 2050 Calculator user can select BECCS by:

%ol
  %li	Assuming that CCS is in commercial operation, by selecting levels 2-4 for CCS.
  %li	Selecting options for biomass to be grown in the UK and/or imported.
  %li	Ensuring that the biomass is in the same form as the fuel demanded by the CCS power plants. For example, gas CCS power plants require biogas.
